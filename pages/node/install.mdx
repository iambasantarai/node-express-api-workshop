# How to install Node.js ?

Node.js can be installed in different ways.

- [Using official package](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Using a system package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

**NOTE:** Recommended to use `LTS` version.

## After Installation

Once installed, verify Node.js installation by running the following commands in your terminal:
```bash copy
node -v
npm -v
```
These commands should display the installed Node.js version and `npm` (Node Package Manager) version, confirming a successful installation.

```bash
$ node -v
v18.18.0
$ npm -v
9.8.1
```

## Node version managers

In real-world scenarios, developers often encounter the necessity to work on diverse projects, each requiring specific `node` versions.

To simplify the management of Node.js versions, various version managers have been developed, offering users a streamlined approach to handling different Node.js versions.
Among the popular choices are tools that facilitate the seamless installation and switching between Node.js versions on a single machine.

Some `node` version managers are:
- `nvm`
- `n` 
- `fnm`

I personally use `n`, No specific reason.
```bash copy
npm install -g n
```

To install `LTS` version using `n` we can simply run following command in your terminal:
```bash copy
n lts
```

> You might need `sudo` previliges in `linux` to use `n`.

```bash
$ sudo n lts
Password:
     copying : node/20.10.0
   installed : v20.10.0 (with npm 10.2.3)
$ node -v
v20.10.0
```

For insights into popular Node.js version managers like `n`, `nvm`, or `fnm`, check their documentation on [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com/).
These resources offer guidance on installation, commands, and features for efficient Node.js version control. We will talk about `packages` later.
