# Hello, world!

So now, let's write our first "Hello, world!" program using `Node.js`

- Create a new directory of your choice

    ```bash copy
    mkdir hello-world
    ```

- Navigate to newly created directory
    
    ```bash copy
    cd hello-world
    ```
- Open your preferred text editor. You can use editors like Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, or any other editor of your choice. I'll be using [vim](https://www.vim.org/) / [neovim](https://neovim.io/) through out the workshop.

    If you are using `Visual Studio Code` you can run following command.

    ```bash copy
    code .
    ```
- Create a new file in your text editor and save it with the name `hello-world.js`. And write the following code:

    ```javascript copy
    console.log("Hello, world! 0/");
    ```
- I'll create the file using the following `bash` command:

    ```bash copy
    echo "console.log('Hello, world! 0/');" > hello.js
    ```
- Let's run the script

    Open your terminal or command prompt. This is where you'll run your Node.js script.
    Type the following command and press enter:

    ```bash copy
    node hello.js
    ```

    Output:

    ```bash
    $ node hello.js
    Hello, world! 0/
    ```
Now that you've conquered the mighty 'Hello, World!' in Node.js, you're officially a JavaScript wizard!
