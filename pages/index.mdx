Hello everyone! Welcome, Welcome to this workshop where we will dip our toes into **[API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)** development with **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)** and **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**.
I'm **Basanta Rana Sampang Rai**, a **Bsc.CSIT** student in the 7th semester and an **Associate Software Engineer** at [Amnil Technologies](https://www.amniltech.com/).
I consider myself a tinkerer who loves exploring and learning new technologies specially those related to backend development.
In my free time, you'll often find me working out, playing guitar, and indulging in various artisanal pursuits that add a balance to my tech and personal life.
