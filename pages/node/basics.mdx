# Javascript

I assume you have some knowledge of `JavaScript`.

#### In case you don't know?
> Javascript is a high level, single threaded, garbage collected, interpreted OR just-in-time ([JIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation)) compiled, prototype based, multi paradigm, dynamic language with a non-blocking event loop.

Let's warm up with a simple number guessing game.

### Generate a random number

Let's make an arrow function to generate a random number between 0 and 99.

```javascript copy
const generateRandomNumber = () => {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
}
```

### Game logic

Let's wrap our main game logic inside immediately invoked function expression ([IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE)).
Inside our `askForGuess()` function we will ask for the user input.

```javascript copy
(() => {
    const secretNumber = generateRandomNumber();

    function askForGuess() {
        console.log("Hello, world 0/");
    }

    askForGuess();
 })()
```

### Ask for user's guess

This function uses `prompt` to take the user guess and stores it in the `guess` variable.

```javascript copy
function askForGuess() {
    const guess = prompt("Please enter your guess: ");
    console.log(`You guessed: ${guess}`);
}
```

### Check for exit/cancellation

If the user presses "Cancel" in the prompt, the game says "Bye. Bye!" and exists by using the `return` statement.

```javascript copy
if(guess === null) {
    console.log("Bye. Bye!");
    return;
}
```

### Validate the user input

If the user enters something that is not a number, it prompts an error message and calls `askForGuess()` again recursively.

```javascript copy
if (isNaN(guess)) {
    console.log("Invalid input. Please enter a number.");
    askForGuess();
}
```

### Compare user guess with secret number

Let's compare the user's guess with the `secretNumber` and provide the feedback based on the comparison.

```javascript copy
if (guess < secretNumber) {
    console.log("Too small!");
    askForGuess();
} else if (guess > secretNumber) {
    console.log("Too big!");
    askForGuess();
} else {
    console.log("You win!");
}
```

### Run the game

Finally, let's see how our game looks like with updated logic. Let's run it.

```javascript copy
// generate a random number between 0 and 99
const generateRandomNumber = () => {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);
}

(() => {
    // initialize a secret number
    const secretNumber = generateRandomNumber();

    // function to ask for the user's guess
    function askForGuess() {
        const guess = prompt("Please enter your guess: ");

        // check for cancellation
        if (guess === null) {
            console.log("Bye. Bye!");
            return;
        }

        // validate user input
        if (isNaN(guess)) {
            console.log("Invalid input. Please enter a number.");
            askForGuess();
        } else {
            console.log(`You guessed: ${guess}`);

            // compare user's guess with secret number
            if (guess < secretNumber) {
                console.log("Too small!");
                askForGuess();
            } else if (guess > secretNumber) {
                console.log("Too big!");
                askForGuess();
            } else {
                console.log("You win!");
            }
        }
    }

    askForGuess();
})()
```

### Let's add attempt limitation

In this section, we'll enhance the existing number guessing game by limiting the user to a specific number of attempts.

```javascript
// generate a random number between 0 and 99
const generateRandomNumber = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);

// Main game logic
(() => {
    // initialize the secretNumber
    const secretNumber = generateRandomNumber();

    // initialize attempts counter
    let attempts = 10;

    // function to ask for the user's guess
    function askForGuess() {
        // use a while loop to manage attempts
        while (attempts > 0) {
            const guess = prompt(`Attempts left: ${attempts}. Please enter your guess:`);

            // check for cancellation
            if (guess === null) {
                console.log("Bye. Bye!");
                return;
            }

            // validate user input
            if (isNaN(guess)) {
                console.log("Invalid input. Please enter a number.");
            } else {
                // decrement attempts counter
                attempts--; 

                console.log(`You guessed: ${guess}`);

                // compare user guess with secret number
                if (guess < secretNumber) {
                    console.log("Too small!");
                } else if (guess > secretNumber) {
                    console.log("Too big!");
                } else {
                    console.log(`Congratulations! You win in ${10 - attempts} attempts.`);
                    return;
                }
            }
        }

        console.log("Sorry, you've reached the maximum number of attempts. The secret number was:", secretNumber);
    }

    // start the game by asking for the first guess
    askForGuess();
})();
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we took a hands-on approach to JavaScript, covering fundamental concepts essential for any developer.
By building a simple number guessing game, we explored `variables`, `functions`, `conditional statements`, `comparison operators`, `IIFE`, `recursion`, and `variable scope` etc.
